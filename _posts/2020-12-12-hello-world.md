I decided to start my own blog. I will mostly focus on my day to day thoughts, tech, game development and everything else that I can think of. I think everyone can enjoy what I will post here.

As you might've noticed, we're currently living through a pandemic. Lockdown lifestyle and monotonne routine are taking my morale to work on my passion projects. I also wanted to try something new for quite some time, so this is a way to express myself. I will try to write those posts on a daily basis, though if you know me, I can miss a day or two. 

This is a short post in which I introduce you to my blog. Later today, I will be talking about my weird experiment. See you!
